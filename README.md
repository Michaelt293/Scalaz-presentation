# Scalaz-presentation

This presentation was prepared using [Marp](https://yhatt.github.io/marp/).

If you wish to experiment with the examples provided in the presentation, I recommend using the [Ammonite REPL](http://www.lihaoyi.com/Ammonite/). This can be installed with the following command (at the time of writing) -

```
sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/amm https://git.io/vMF2M && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/amm && amm
```

Several examples and the layout of this presentation were inspired by [Learning Scalaz](http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/).
